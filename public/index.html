				<p>BillToText.com turns PDFs of federal legislation into text files. 
					It provides a formatted document that you can download and edit with a word processor program.
				</p>
				<p>To use, upload your bill. BillToText publishes the bill text in your browser 
					and allows you to download it as a .DOCX file. If you open the file in 
					Microsoft Word, BillToText preserves the line numbers on each page. 
					You can open it as a Google doc as well, although Google does not support line numbers.
				</p>
				<p>BillToText is designed specifically for discussion drafts of legislation prepared by 
					legislative counsel in the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives.
				</p>
				<p>We do not retain or share copies of legislation uploaded to the website. We do use Google analytics 
					to track general information about users of the website. (Here is our privacy policy).
