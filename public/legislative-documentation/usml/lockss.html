<P>Digital Dissemination of Access Content Packages</p>

<P>Interest has been expressed by customers and partners in creating their own digital collections of content. This includes building digital collections by accepting digital files and metadata disseminated by GPO's Federal Digital System (FDsys).</p> 


<P>GPO will make available Access Content Packages (ACPs) to download and store on local systems. For instance, for Federal depository libraries (FDLs), this may assist in efforts to build digital collections at their libraries.</p> 
 

<P>GPO will continue to maintain responsibility for managing Federal content within scope of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), and providing free and permanent access to this information.</p> 


<p>LOCKSS system has permission to collect, preserve, and serve this Archival Unit.</p>
